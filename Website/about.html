        <p>"Dogcrawl is a web crawler to search for shopping items in one convenient place!</p>
        <p>Developed in 2017 for CEN4020 by the DogCrawl team, it's main purpose is to save time and money by searching across many different sites to find the best deals in ten seconds or less. It works by using a custom built web-scraper that will programmatically search the source code of each website and search for the products you want.</p>
        <p>It is primarily written in Python, utilizing the bs4, lxml, and re libraries, which interface with PHP and finally AJAX to bring those results to you in one easy to use dynamically loaded webpage."</p>
